# AtmSimulator-JavaProject-With-GUI-And-MySQL-Database

In this project i have used Java Swing to create a Graphical Interface of a Working ATM. 

I have also used MySQL database to Store and Retrive data.

In this project we can create a new User and store the User information in the database. 

After User Creation is Finisher we can assign User with an Account no and Pin no. 

By using the assigned Account no and Pin no the User can login in to the ATM. 

After Logging into the ATM the User can perform the operations such as Deposit, Cash WithDrawal, Fast Cash, Mini Statement, Pin Change, Balance Enquiry. 

All the Operation performed will be Stored in the MySQL Database.
